Seek immediate medical attention if the pain is severe, lasts more than a few minutes, is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or radiates to the arm or jaw, as these could indicate a heart attack. For less severe pain, consider resting, taking deep breaths, and avoiding strenuous activities, but speaking to a healthcare professional is still advisable to determine the cause."
